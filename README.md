# csc200

The final project in this class is to produce a portfolio of at least 50 sample c# programs that demonstrate topics discussed in the class.  This repository will contain a collection of possible (suggested) sample programs provided by the instructor for task #1 (below).

Project components (tasks) for each sample program:
1) find suitable example programs hopefully written by professional programmers,
2) carefully read the program code to figure out (as much as possible) what the program does and how it does it
3) document your findings by annotating the code with program comments that demonstrate your understanding of the program
4) compile and get the program running... debug it if necessary
5) augment the program to better demonstrate its functionality
6) capture the program output and append it to the end of your source code

I will be looking for:
1) the original source code of the sample program
2) document the source and (if possible) the author of the sample program
3) summarize the program functionality in a one-liner comment
4) summarize your changes and improvements to the program
5) the final source code of the sample program
6) a terminal comment containing the sample program output

There are lots of opportunities you can use to develop your programming skills:
1. expand the functionality of the sample program
2. put the sample program aside, and rewrite it from scratch... as much as possible on your own
3. choose and implement challenge programs from textbooks, such as "Cracking the Coding Interview," or one of the websites, such as "leetcode.com," or "hackerrank.com," etc.
